# AppGame
A simple and elegant app.

Since I still didn't understand anything after doing online tutorials, I decided to screw around until I understood stuff.
At the moment, AppGame is simply a button and some text that changes when you press the button.
Upon clicking the button, the background will change colors, and a counter will tell you how many times you have clicked the button.
More features will be added later.
